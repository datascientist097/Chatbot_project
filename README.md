# Chatbot_project
# PyTech Chatbot
This repository contains the code for a simple chatbot that can be used to have conversations with users. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of text conversations, and can generate responses to a variety of prompts.
## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, install the dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the chatbot by running the following command:

```
python main.py


The chatbot will then be available on your local machine. You can interact with the chatbot by typing in a question or statement. The chatbot will then generate a response.

## Features

The chatbot can currently generate responses to the following types of prompts:

* Greetings
* Questions about the weather
* Questions about the time
* Requests for help
* Jokes

## Future Features

I plan to add the following features to the chatbot in the future:

* The ability to generate responses to more complex prompts
* The ability to learn from conversations with users
* The ability to generate different types of creative text content, such as poems, stories, and scripts
